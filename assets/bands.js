Something that means alot more. The sound has evolved from the depths of the bayou to the swamps at Tamoka. Kenny has finally found his true sound with the help from his beautiful soulmate/trash queen Suzanne Burkhardt. Suzanne who is classically trained on piano and viola met Kenny on Tinder by sheer chance.

After a chance encounter between Carli Acosta and Kyle Fink, the two guitarists/vocalists began to craft original songs and track demos on Garageband. Rhythm section Jake Karner, on drums, and Raven Nieto, on bass, assembled the full band in March 2018. Each member of Palomino Blond supported each other's former bands on the local circuit of South Florida for close to six years. The eclectic mix of musical backgrounds in the group (indie rock, hardcore, jazz, reggae, pop, industrial) combines to form a sound all their own. The band's first two singles, \"Creature Natural\" and \"i'm not rite 4 u,\" reflect two sides of the same coin: at times crushing, heavy, and dark—yet at times dreamy, upbeat, and groovy. Palomino Blond call Miami home, but the band of less than one year have already taken their live set out on the road. Summer of 2018 saw Palomino Blond's week of shows throughout Florida (Miami, Gainesville, Orlando), New Orleans, LA; and Austin, TX. The band has begun work on their debut LP to release mid-2019. Palomino Blond's 6-track demo EP is out now.</p>",

Heading back into the studio later that year to begin work on their forthcoming debut LP, the 10 tracks that emerged a few months later brought their forthright vision to new, blistering heights. Their boomy, low-fi sound soothes and scrapes in equal measure, with Bollinger’s bright, wispy vocals turning into adrenal-fueled rants with little warning. Caught somewhere between Savages, The Jesus Lizard, B-52s, and The Eurythmics, Broken Baby is a band for punching the air and driving a little too fast.</p>",

Thankfully we are correcting this with the release of Labyrinths - 14 fast paced rippers that have been described by at least one person as sounding like “early No Age meets Tyvek on uppers”. With a constantly evolving line up it is easy to say this is the most aggro version of the band to date. There’s an occasional sax skronk (courtesy of Mikal Cronin), piano plink-plunk, and the spare synth squiggle here and there, but more often than not it’s a batch of four-on-the-floor pogo-friendly numbers that will have even the most jaded message board lurkers rethinking what the Los Angeles underground has to offer.</p>",

        "info" : "<p>Anemic Royalty is a garage rock band from Louisville Kentucky. Since their formation in 2014 these guys have been hanging out in basements, backyards, dismantled minivans, music festivals, and rock clubs, writing and performing loud melodic hook-laden rock songs.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2013 two shaggy haired weirdos from Highland Middle school, Jeremy Rochman (Vox/guitar) and Seamus Coyle (Guitar/vox) who didn’t know much about anything discovered a mutual unconditional love for guitars and Green Day. Apparently that was enough because after a couple of out of tune jam sessions in the basement they decided to start their first band Sucker Punch. After playing a couple birthday parties and lock-ins worth of Nirvana and Foo Fighters covers, Jeremy’s buddy Oden rang up and said “yo I just got this bass for Christmas can a come jam?” And then there were three. Miles was the last to join. It was weird because he didn’t practice, he just somehow just could play the drums one day…. and that became Anemic Royalty.</p><p><br></p><p>Their first year they played shows wherever they could. Street festivals, birthday parties, the basement and about a year or so in, they went into the studio to record their first demo “Baby Fang”. Following that release they began playing more shows and writing more songs and hanging out in more basements and minivans and finally it was time to start their new project. To do this the way they wanted, they started working with musician and producer Extraordinaire Scott Carney and beast behind the mixing board Dave Chale. The basic tracks came quickly… then after months of work, more tracking, raising funds, mixing, and tweaking, they released their first single “Better Hands” and a little while later the second “Fire + Ice”. The record, Anemic Royalty, was released March 31st 2018.</p>",

Musically, she bends genres at will, blending influences from Kate Bush to The Replacements to Leslie Gore.

Almost funny real story, Dennul summoned Nasserti from the forsaken underworld and together they plan to take on the fudging world with sicky-sick riffy-riffs and half-baked stand-up humour. SIGH* Long boring story, Danniel De La Cruz and Nasser Al-Rabeah had stumbled upon each other at some local shows, but they had never got to properly talk. Danniel was looking to form a band and asked Nasser to join after both played at a late night impromptu jam session at a parking lot at Florida International University. Once Nasser accepted the offer, Danniel brought song ideas and loose riffs to Nasser's garage and both started jamming. Through friends and acquaintances, they started having shows here and there, from Homestead to Deerfield. In Summer 2018, they played at a going-away-to-college friend's party where common friend Sebastian got to hear them for the first time and invited them to record their songs. In October 2018, they went into the studio and recorded 8 live tracks for their debut album 'IMPERIAL'. In December 2018, they finalized the mixing and mastering and during Winter Solstice on the 21st, they released their first single ever titled 'MAJESTY'. Now January 2019, they are getting everything ready for IMPERIAL.</p>",

(A link directly to the video under \"band website\") I got a sneak peek into Harry's record. The songwriting is cinematic and the composition unsettling in a lovely, haunting sort of way.

The music is rock, but the band's epic sound tips its hat to country, pop, jazz, post rock, punk, early R&amp;B, classical and 90's underground sounds. \"Our songs are all over the place,\" the band says, \"We have grungy post rock, up tempo dance songs, pop punk and alt. country songs.

In January of 2016, the fearsome foursome entered Panther Pro Audio with engineer/producer Dan “Kish o’ Death” Kishbaugh,(Biters, Vektor, Bad Luck 13) to record their first 10n songs. With a healthy respect and understanding of their musical legacy and an intrepid attytood towards the future, Sheena &amp; Thee Nosebleeds proudly fly the flag of Philadelphia Rock n’ Soul.</p><p><br></p><p>THE REVOLUTION WILL BE AMPLIFIED.</p><p><br></p>",

Having survived the codeine-and-lean-fueled apocalypse that left many of his early 2000’s counterparts crushed, ground up and isolated, Kavorkian, in an act of self-preservation, reinvents himself; he is, after all, under that unkempt mane, behind that voice like a distorted rasp calling from a Cybertronian jail, a cyborg, able to download new programs and override the glitches– shifty AnR’s; wishy-washy youth born trap/southern rap pathogens; uninspired and directionless record labels– that sent many of his contemporaries to the scrap heap. It’s on this pile of discarded rapper parts that Kavorkian has erected Manikineter, a project as much an emotional take on minimalism as it is a meditation on encroaching paranoia and a distrust of the meme-led generation.</p>",

Bubbles (Guitar, Vocals) and Washboard Ben (Percussion, Vocals) cut their teeth on the blues deep in the subways of Chicago, busking for change and the occasional dollar. Using only a guitar, washboard, sock cymbal, assorted percussion and a suitcase bass drum -the duo and their lean, archaic setup evoke the homespun, kitchen-sink aesthetic of rural, pre-war blues and country, while blending into it an aggressive and modern electricity to create a sound at-once both nostalgic and distinctly progressive. The Bubbles Brown sound defies expectations, and their rich and reverent brand of the blues, country and jazz of the 20s and 30s greatly exceeds the sum of its parts, transforming stages of any size into roadside juke joints and skeptics into believers.</p>",

        "info" : "<p>Brewster is the recording project of Mark Bucci, a New Jersey songwriter with a gift for zooming into familiar scenes—long road trips, tense run-ins at liquor stores, two people falling in love while a record plays—until you can see your own reflection in them. In the spirit of&nbsp;<u>Wilco</u>’s Jeff Tweedy and&nbsp;<u>Songs: Ohia</u>’s Jason Molina, Bucci writes songs that are borne of compassion, even when they’re filtered through a fog of melancholy. The sound is equal parts golden FM twang and jagged, emotional intensity.</p><p><br></p><p>The genesis of&nbsp;<em>Forever Better Kissers</em>, Brewster’s compact but wildly dynamic debut album, took place as Bucci toured throughout 2016 as the guitarist for cult favorite indie folk band ManDancing. Driving through the country during an election year, Bucci says he found himself “getting in touch with the American sadness,” writing songs that interrogated a well of anxiety for small moments of unity. He compares his first batch of solo songs after leaving the group to a series of photographs. They also play like pages from a faded scrapbook, fascinating both for what they reveal and the story left between the lines.</p><p><br></p><p>Self-produced by Bucci,&nbsp;<em>Forever Better Kissers&nbsp;</em>is a lo-fi patchwork of homespun, country-influenced anthems with his earnest, quavering vocals at the forefront. Accompanied by collaborators including his brother Chuck on keys and ManDancing’s Thomas DeVinko on drums, Bucci creates a sense of intimacy that’s consistent in the album’s warm production and its thematic concerns, dealing with the slow dissolution of a long-term relationship. “The past year for me has been a lot of dealing with things that I should have dealt with while growing up,” Bucci explains. “I always felt like your life moves in different phases, and once a phase has past it’s over. Now I realize that it’s all part of the same picture.” With Brewster’s own story just beginning, Bucci has crafted a vivid statement of empathy and clear-eyed ambition. It’s a picture worth getting lost in.</p>",

As such, New Jersey’s&nbsp;Fire&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Motion&nbsp;find themselves overcoming these doubts across their first “proper” release, an EP called Still, I Try. With the EP’s five tracks, songwriter Adrian Amador spent years reworking the structures of every song, as well as their lyrical content and the vocal presentation.</p><p><br></p><p>The process of creating Still, I Try began in 2014 when Amador attempted to self-produce the record, a short-lived effort that saw him struggling with the way that the production seemed too similar to the previous&nbsp;Fire&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Motion&nbsp;demos, but less interesting. It wasn’t until 2015 that Amador entered the studio with his friend and producer Adam Cichocki that the songs started to come together in a way that was satisfying. For the first time, Amador had the opportunity to spend as much time as needed to feel 100% satisfied with the work he was creating. Thus, there isn’t a single moment on the EP that wasn’t meticulously constructed over the course of several years.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, Still, I Try is the first documentation of Amador’s collaboration with friends, opening up a whole new dimension of the band. Up to this point,&nbsp;Fire&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Motion&nbsp;was primarily a solo project, with Amador writing and recording everything himself. However, the addition of vocals from Avery Salermo and contributions of trumpet, keyboards, and glockenspiel from Phelan Tupik have created a fuller sound, resulting in the first&nbsp;Fire&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Motion&nbsp;record feels that feels fully satisfying for Amador.</p><p><br></p><p>All told, the production of Still, I Try took the better part of three years, with a lot of time and effort focused on making sure every bit of the five songs was absolutely perfect, with every obstacle necessary to get the songs where they needed to be. Finally, Amador has something that he can be proud of. With Still, I Try,&nbsp;Fire&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Motion&nbsp;is ready to make their mark on the scene with interesting, meaningful songs.</p><p><br></p><p>written by Zac Gelfand</p>",

        "info" : "<p>Seamstress was born Gabriella Chavez December 3rd, 1991 in Hoboken , NJ. At an early age, she found solace in art. Exploring the visual arts then traveling towards music she used the mediums to make sense of the chaos that ensued around her. Exposed to heartbreak at an early age, Gabriella began to quickly survey the different corners of her emotions. Using songwriting as a tool to communicate that which she couldn’t always understand, her experiences have greatly shaped the beautifully haunting sound for which Seamstress has come to be known.</p><p>Gabriella met the other half of Seamstress, Charlie Sztyk, in early 2013 through friends in the local NJ music scene. Their debut EP, “Gabriella,” was released independently in August 2014. Produced, recorded, and mixed by Charlie in their home studio dubbed “The Belly of the Whale,” Seamstress created a body of work all their own. They later released their single “Weak Too” in March 2017. As of 2019, they have released a new single titled “Everything”. They are currently writing and recording more material to be released this year.</p><p><em>Seamstress is an indie-rock band with folk roots that explore and push the definition of the genre. Plaintive, powerful vocals express vulnerable songs about love found and estranged and a relentless hope and need to carry on. Finding strength in fragility, Seamstress has cultivated a catalog of moving songs that entrance every listener. Their sound has often been compared to Cat Power, David Bazan, Sharon Van Etten, and Bright Eyes.</em></p>",

Comprised of Tracy Jean (drums), Ariel Isa (bass), and Marco Argiro (vocals, guitar) the group formed at the end of 2017 with the intention of having fun and helping to do away with the cookie cutter, overproduced sound that has become the norm these days. The Tenders are here to shake things up by bringing some grit back to their current home in MUSIC CITY. Their tunes are catchy ear worms with raw, visceral, and evocative lyrics that hint at a time of rhinestone nudes and blue suede shoes. Tracy Jean’s pounding drums will have you bopping around and shaking your heads in unison to the catchy and propulsive rhythms alongside Ariel’s thumping fuzz tone bass all while Marco’s reverb-soaked guitar and his coarse smoker’s voice croons long into the night.</strong></p>",

        "info" : "<p>In 2014, Nashville-born singer/songwriter Joseph Jared traded his acoustic guitar for a Telecaster and joined forces with friends to form The Dangerous Method. They created a sound which fused the confessional melodicism of music from the ‘70s with the quirky intensity of alternative and punk bands from the ‘90s, resulting in a potent blend of raw, power-pop tinged alt rock. The band began crafting material for their debut record, a concept album entitled “Cinema Junkie”, featuring 10 songs exploring movies, love, obsession and addiction. They released the album in April 2016. The band has played regularly around Nashville, and will be taking their music on the road. \"Travels,\" a new EP, was released in July 2017.</p>",

With influences from The Black Keys and Led Zeppelin to Norah Jones they are led by bluesy vocals, strong lyrics, and roaring guitars that create a sound reminiscent of the 70s but making it all new.</p><p><br></p><p>They worked for two years on their next release and put out their second record, “Golden Days,” in October of 2014. They developed their sound and really toned in their own brand of fuzzy rock. They continued to perform live as often as they could for the next two years and they began working on their third release in 2016.</p><p><br></p><p>After three years of playing live and working on new tunes they released their third record “Trouble Comes” on October 31st, 2017. This is their hardest rocking record yet and boast lots of dirty riffs and dark grooves to go along with their deep and powerful vocals. Be sure to be on the lookout for them to be on tour in the next coming months.</p>",

Despite the album only arriving now, brothers Jim and Jack Ivins have already received glowing comparisons to the likes of The Killers, Stereophonics &amp; Arctic Monkeys from places like AXS, Chorus.fm and Kings of A&amp;R, among others, while also sharing the stage with artists such as Switchfoot, Rooney, Night Riots, Airborne Toxic Event, Parachute, Mae, From Indian Lakes &amp; The Ataris.</p><p><br></p><p>Backed by a powerhouse team, The Code Duello was brought to life with the help of Grammy winner Michael Rosen (AFI, Papa Roach), Grammy nominee Mark Needham (Imagine Dragons, The Killers), American Music Award winner Bill Leverty (Firehouse), Interscope Records co-founder Beau Hill (Alice Cooper, RATT) and Anthony \"Rocky\" Gallo (John Legend, Carrie Underwood), as well as a stellar lineup of top notch talent from the band’s original home of Virginia such as Pedro Aida, Andreas Magnusson, John Morand, Steve Barber, Ben Green and Alex DeJong.</p><p><br></p><p>Previously based in Richmond, VA and New York City, The Ivins are now residents of Music City.

        "info" : "<p>Kyle Emerson, the buzzy indie-rocker from Denver, Colorado, is back with, “May You Find Peace,” the first single from his upcoming sophomore album. As a follow up from Emerson’s 2017 debut album, Dorothy Alice, “May You Find Peace,” shows the singer/songwriter expanding his garage-pop sensibilities with lush full-band arrangements and plenty of toothsome melodic hooks. At turns dreamy and driving, Emerson’s sophomore release bridges classic and contemporary sounds to create a warm, inviting, and introspective atmosphere. “May You Find Peace” was co-produced with Emerson's drummer Mark Anderson, who also took over engineering duties alongside James Barone (Beach House, Nathaniel Rateliff, Tennis). Find Emerson on the road this summer touring alongside the likes of Ages &amp; Ages and more to be announced soon.</p>",

Berry's sophomore effort entitled \"Mean Machine\" has been called \"the perfect example of an old-school genre mixing seemlesslu with a contemporary sound as an intoxicating blend of rock and blues\" (Pop Wrapped) and earned a 9/10 from Blues Rock Review. Most recently, songs ”Kiss Like” and ”Bad Dog” were featured by Marshall Speakers anf Showtime’s Shameless respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>\"With a voice that could scare the venom out of a rattlesnake, Berry is poised to break through to the mainstream with 'Mean Machine'\"(Consequence of Sound).</p><p><br></p>",

        "info" : "<p>\"Flummox\" is a word one may use to describe the act of being confused, bewildered, &amp; perplexed. For example: \"I was rather flummoxed today when I discovered myuncle on the couch cuddling with a baby manatee covered in cod liver oil.\" or \"My uncle did not mean to flummox me when I walked in on him having intimate relations with a greasy sea cow.\" This is the feeling that the band, Flummox, channels into their sound &amp; stage show - &amp; they don't even have to get your uncle involved.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Formed in the summer of 2012 in a run down trailer by an old Tennessean highway, Flummox was born in the name of all things weird, unusual, and completely insane. The brain child of two eccentric, magician, teenaged delinquents, Blake Dellinger &amp; Drew Jones, the duo decided to create a band with no sense of genre labels, sound restrictions, or strict musical guidelines. Flummox could be whatever they wanted it to be, and so far, it has been. With the genre of their music hopping among the sounds of heavy rock, funk, extreme metal, jazz fusion, progressive rock, avant-garde, bluegrass, power pop, to doo-wop, the band truly didn't plan on limiting the bounds of what they played to a particular demographic. Teaming up with local producer and recording engineer, Dave Summers, Flummox recorded and self released their first three track E.P. in the fall of 2012. This release attracted the attention of the Minnesota based experimental metal label, Tridroid Records (Voivod, Gorguts, Marduk, Unleashed, Wicked Inquisition), who signed the band for a full length album in late 2013.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>After signing with Tridroid, the band recorded &amp; released two studio albums with Dave Summers; 2014’s “Phlummoxygen” &amp; 2016’s “Selcouth.” On the subject of Flummox’s debut album, No Clean Singing called it, \"...a modern classic,\" with Decibel Magazine saying, \"If you're into heaviness &amp; weirdness, you've come to the right spot.\" With the release of Flummox’s heavier sophomore effort, Terrorizer Magazine gave it an \"8/10\" stating it sounded like \"Sludge-meets-psychedelia-meets-doom-meets-Monty Python-meets-Motown.\" Metal Injection called it, \"the mark of truly original and out there music,\" &amp; Ripple Music hailed, \"the band excels way beyond anyone’s expectations.\" Playing dozens of shows throughout the east coast &amp; the southern United States in support of these records, the band quickly became known for bewildering stage shows involving ridiculously loud amps, absurd costumes &amp; props, genre hopping musical dynamics, bizarre improvisation, &amp; taking crowd participation to a strange &amp; sometimes creepy level.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>By the summer of 2016, the band had decided to cut ties with Tridroid Records, &amp; had split with drummer, Jody Lester. Deciding to drop the power trio dynamic that Flummox had maintained, the band added Alan Pfeifer &amp; Justin Smith to drums and second guitar later that year. With this came more freedom to carry out a variety of new theatrical &amp; musical textures to the band. The stage shows became more elaborate, and much of the band’s new music had begun to encompass entirely new musical textures. After a successful east coast tour and the digital release of a live demo, \"Garage Prog,\" the band added musician &amp; actress, Parker Lampley, into the fold to incorporate not only her multi-instrumental &amp; vocal talent, but also her experience in Theatre.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As of 2018, the band has shared the stage with a wide variety of performing artists, including The Obsessed, Eyehategod, Fable Cry, Chuck Mosley of Faith No More, Black Crown Initiate, Howling Giant, Iron Man, the Beyond Wings Circus, Black Fast, The Dead Deads, Random Conflict, Oubliette, Mos Generator, Place of Skulls, &amp; Dee Calhoun. The band currently exists as a quintet featuring Dellinger, Jones, Lampley, Pfeifer, &amp; new guitarist, Chase McCutcheon. With a third album slated to be released in the summer of 2018, Flummox is just getting started with their quest for world wide domination of the sanity &amp; free will of mankind. Prepare to get flummoxed, or get the fuck out.</p>",

        "info" : "<p>Fable Cry, the theatrical scamp rock band from Nashville, TN, draws inspiration, both musically and poetically, from all things imaginative, mythical, and spooky. With a colorfully haunting melody and a flourishing sweep of the hand, they will weave their strand of tales and take you with them on a wild ride, from the eerie solitude of a dark forest to the wily seas; from the tippy top of a wind swept mountain pass to the grittiest alleyways of sordid scum! They create a wildly unique experience and one that is not to be missed!</p><p><br></p><p>Their story began when Zach Ferrin first started putting his imagination to song. The year was 2010, and he was determined to take the music, art, and stories he had been cultivating to one great platform where he could share them. He and and his sister, former member Kirstie Ferrin, had half of what would become their first album written before they would have a title by which to call themselves. The songs were all rambunctious, melodic, and wrapped in themes of legend and myth. \"Fable Cry\" was born, and in 2011 they released their self-titled debut album. Between the two of them they played guitar, violin, accordion, drums, bells, kazoo, ukelele, banjo, and cello, and they tried their best to include as much of it as possible in their live shows, along with humorous intros, crowd participation, and twistedly playful \"Story Time\" between songs.</p><p>�By the end of 2013, after 4 elaborate music videos, several national tours, and lots of writing, Zach decided that it was time to expand Fable Cry and build a band that could properly play these songs that were too big for him alone. That void was soon filled by a cluster of amazing musicians and they immediately hit the studio to record and release their first single/music video together in the Autumn of 2014 entitled “Fancy Dancing”. And the new Fable Cry was born.</p><p>�Now a fuller, darker, and more mature band, Jo Cleary (violin, vocals), Scott Fernandez (bass), and Rachel Gerlach (drums), and Zach Ferrin (vocals, guitars) could perform the songs the way they had always been written, packed with energy and dynamics, while maintaining (and inevitably amplifying) the band's theatrics, costumes, makeup, and overall ruckusness, and developing their sound that they came to call, \"Theatrical Scamp Rock\". They spent the next few months writing and recording what would become their Sophomore album, filled with songs inspired by life through classic horror tales and originally spooky themes entitled, “We’ll Show You Where the Monsters Are.” After two more music videos to precede the album, it was released on August 25th, 2015.</p><p><br></p><p>In January 2016, they hit the new year running by releasing their eighth official music video, and touring on their new material. By the fall of that year, Nic Giordano, would take over the drum thrown, and writing for a new album would begin - a horror-themed concept album, set to release in 2017.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Fable: A fictitious narrative or statement. A legendary story of supernatural happenings in which animals and inanimate objects speak and act like human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>Cry: To scream. To utter a characteristic sound or call. Cry havoc. To give alarm without occasion. Proclamation. A pack of hounds. To cry out with such gusto.</p>",
